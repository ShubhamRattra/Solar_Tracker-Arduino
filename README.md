# Solar_Tracker-Arduino

In this the solar panels move in the direction of the sun.

It has 4 LDR's which senses that in which direction there is maximum intensity of light and the with the help of 2 servos(for x and y axis) 
So the solar panels get maximum intensity of light and generates max electricity.
The panel is connected to a battery which gets charged while the panel is generating electicity.
The servos get power to move from these batteries so the panel does not require any outer source for its operation.
